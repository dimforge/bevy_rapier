//! # Official integration of Rapier to the Bevy game engine
//!
//! Rapier is a set of two Rust crates `rapier2d` and `rapier3d` for efficient cross-platform
//! physics simulation. Its target application include video games, animation, robotics, etc.
//!
//! The `bevy_rapier` projects implements two other crates `bevy_rapier2d` and `bevy_rapier3d` which
//! defines physics plugins for the Bevy game engine.
//!
//! User documentation for `bevy_rapier` is on [the official Rapier site](https://rapier.rs/docs/).
