# bevy_rapier custom benches

`bevy_rapier_benches3d` 's objective is to measure timings with detailed information
without spending too much time running multiple times expensive benchmarks.

It is implemented as a standalone binary, running different scenes setup, gathering information
and outputs them at the end.

```sh
cargo run --release -p bevy_rapier_benches3d
```

## cargo bench

For short-lived benchmarks based on statistical analysis,
benchmarks can be run through the [divan](https://github.com/nvzqz/divan) bench harness.

```sh
cargo bench -p bevy_rapier3d
```
